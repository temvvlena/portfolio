      Jogging or running is a popular form of physical activity.
      About one in five Australians try running (or jogging) at
      some stage in their life. Running is an appealing exercise
      because it doesn't cost a lot to take part and you can run at
      any time that suits you. Some runners choose to participate
      in fun runs, athletics races or marathons. If you are
      interested in competing with other runners, contact your
      local running club.

        Pay attention to your moods and feelings.
        Don't assume your negative thoughts or feelings are just
        part of being a teenager. If you're worried about
        something, ask for help. Everyone wants to help you. So,
        please do not ever hesitate to ask for help.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need
        it.If you can't talk to your parents, talk to a
        favorite teacher or counselor at school. Find an adult you
        can trust. If you're feeling really sad or are thinking
        about harming yourself, get help right away.
      </li>
      <li>
       Accept yourself.If you feel like you have
        low self-esteem or a poor body image, talk to someone about
        it. Even just talking to a friend can help. Everyone is
        different and unique.And that uniquness makes you special
        from anyone else in the world. You are special.
      </li>
      <li>
        Respect the others.Even though you have
        nothing to give someone, remember you have mounth and body.
        You can always give nice compliments to your friends. This
        might be the world's best gifts to someone. So, please do
        not hesitate to help others and it will help you feel
        better too.
