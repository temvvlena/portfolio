    <p>
      Your mood and your mental health affect every aspect of your
      life, from how you feel about yourself to your relationships
      with others and your physical health. I suggest following
      tips to improve your the way you look at something. Remember
      being Positive is the key to everything
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Know the signs of mental illness.</strong>These
        include∶
        <ul>
          <li>anxiety
          </li>
          <li>depression
          </li>
          <li>excessive tiredness
          </li>
          <li>weight gain or loss
          </li>
          <li>out-of-character personality changes
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay attention to your moods and feelings.
        Don't assume your negative thoughts or feelings are just
        part of being a teenager. If you're worried about
        something, ask for help. Everyone wants to help you. So,
        please do not ever hesitate to ask for help.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need
        it.If you can't talk to your parents, talk to a
        favorite teacher or counselor at school. Find an adult you
        can trust. If you're feeling really sad or are thinking
        about harming yourself, get help right away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accept yourself.If you feel like you have
        low self-esteem or a poor body image, talk to someone about
        it. Even just talking to a friend can help. Everyone is
        different and unique.And that uniquness makes you special
        from anyone else in the world. You are special.
      </li>
      <li>
        Respect the others.Even though you have
        nothing to give someone, remember you have mounth and body.
        You can always give nice compliments to your friends. This
        might be the world's best gifts to someone. So, please do
        not hesitate to help others and it will help you feel
        better too.
      </li>
    </ul>
